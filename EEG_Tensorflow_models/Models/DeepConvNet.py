    """ Keras implementation of the Deep Convolutional Network as described in
    Schirrmeister et. al. (2017), Human Brain Mapping.
    
    This implementation assumes the input is a 2-second EEG signal sampled at 
    128Hz, as opposed to signals sampled at 250Hz as described in the original
    paper. We also perform temporal convolutions of length (1, 5) as opposed
    to (1, 10) due to this sampling rate difference. 
    
    Note that we use the max_norm constraint on all convolutional layers, as 
    well as the classification layer. We also change the defaults for the
    BatchNormalization layer. We used this based on a personal communication 
    with the original authors.
